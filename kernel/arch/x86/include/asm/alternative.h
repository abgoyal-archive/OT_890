/*
 * Alternative inline assembly for SMP.
 *
 * The LOCK_PREFIX macro defined here replaces the LOCK and
 * LOCK_PREFIX macros used everywhere in the source tree.
 *
 * SMP alternatives use the same data structures as the other
 * alternatives and the X86_FEATURE_UP flag to indicate the case of a
 * UP system running a SMP kernel.  The existing apply_alternatives()
 * works fine for patching a SMP kernel for UP.
 *
 * The SMP alternative tables can be kept after boot and contain both
 * UP and SMP versions of the instructions to allow switching back to
 * SMP at runtime, when hotplugging in a new CPU, which is especially
 * useful in virtualized environments.
 *
 * The very common lock prefix is handled as special case in a
 * separate table which is a pure address list without replacement ptr
 * and size information.  That keeps the table sizes small.
