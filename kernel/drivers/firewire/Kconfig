comment "A new alternative FireWire stack is available with EXPERIMENTAL=y"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL=n

comment "Enable only one of the two stacks, unless you know what you are doing"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL

config FIREWIRE
	tristate "New FireWire stack, EXPERIMENTAL"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	select CRC_ITU_T
	help
	  This is the "Juju" FireWire stack, a new alternative implementation
	  designed for robustness and simplicity.  You can build either this
	  stack, or the old stack (the ieee1394 driver, ohci1394 etc.) or both.
	  Please read http://ieee1394.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Juju_Migration
	  before you enable the new stack.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the module will be
	  called firewire-core.

	  This module functionally replaces ieee1394, raw1394, and video1394.
	  To access it from application programs, you generally need at least
	  libraw1394 version 2.  IIDC/DCAM applications also need libdc1394
	  version 2.  No libraries are required to access storage devices
	  through the firewire-sbp2 driver.

config FIREWIRE_OHCI
	tristate "OHCI-1394 controllers"
	depends on PCI && FIREWIRE
	help
	  Enable this driver if you have a FireWire controller based
	  on the OHCI specification.  For all practical purposes, this
	  is the only chipset in use, so say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here:  The module will be
	  called firewire-ohci.  It replaces ohci1394 of the classic IEEE 1394
	  stack.

	  NOTE:

	  You should only build either firewire-ohci or the old ohci1394 driver,
	  but not both.  If you nevertheless want to install both, you should
	  configure them only as modules and blacklist the driver(s) which you
	  don't want to have auto-loaded.  Add either

	      blacklist firewire-ohci
	  or
	      blacklist ohci1394
	      blacklist video1394
	      blacklist dv1394

	  to /etc/modprobe.conf or /etc/modprobe.d/* and update modprobe.conf
	  depending on your distribution.  The latter two modules should be
	  blacklisted together with ohci1394 because they depend on ohci1394.

	  If you have an old modprobe which doesn't implement the blacklist
	  directive, use "install modulename /bin/true" for the modules to be
	  blacklisted.

config FIREWIRE_OHCI_DEBUG
	bool
	depends on FIREWIRE_OHCI
	default y

config FIREWIRE_SBP2
	tristate "Storage devices (SBP-2 protocol)"
	depends on FIREWIRE && SCSI
	help
	  This option enables you to use SBP-2 devices connected to a
	  FireWire bus.  SBP-2 devices include storage devices like
	  harddisks and DVD drives, also some other FireWire devices
	  like scanners.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here:  The module will be
	  called firewire-sbp2.  It replaces sbp2 of the classic IEEE 1394
	  stack.

	  You should also enable support for disks, CD-ROMs, etc. in the SCSI
	  configuration section.
