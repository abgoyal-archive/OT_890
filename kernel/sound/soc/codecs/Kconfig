          Normally ASoC codec drivers are only built if a machine driver which
          uses them is also built since they are only usable with a machine
          driver.  Selecting this option will allow these drivers to be built
          without an explicit machine driver for test and development purposes.

	  Support for the bus types used to access the codecs to be built must
	  be selected separately.

          If unsure select "N".
