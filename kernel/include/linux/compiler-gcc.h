 * This macro obfuscates arithmetic on a variable address so that gcc

 *
 * This is needed because the C standard makes it undefined to do
 * pointer arithmetic on "objects" outside their boundaries and the
 * gcc optimizers assume this is the case. In particular they
 * assume such arithmetic does not wrap.
 *
 * A miscompilation has been observed because of this on PPC.
 * To work around it we hide the relationship of the pointer and the object
 * using this macro.
 *
 * Versions of the ppc64 compiler before 4.1 had a bug where use of
 * RELOC_HIDE could trash r30. The bug can be worked around by changing
 * the inline assembly constraint from =g to =r, in this particular
 * case either is valid.
